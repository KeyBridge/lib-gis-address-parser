Background:

This project is based upon jgeocoder, an attempt to build a Java Geocoder
using the US Census Tiger database.

Credit for jgeocoder goes to zl25-drexel (whomever that is). For context,
zl25-drexel also built the "Geo-Google - Address Standardizer", a web client
that provides the same (or similar) functionality.

jgeocoder was created 2008-04-03 and appears to have been abandoned shortly
thereafter. No updates have been made since the last SVN commit in July 2008.
A similar project with the same source code was posted to github under another
author in 2009.

jgeocoder itself was modeled after the PERL CPAN Geo::Coder::US module.

This code fork reorganizes classes into a logical hierarchy, renames
many classes according to their logical function, adds and improves class
and method documentation, and simplifies access to the parser via standard
a WSIF-aware wrapper class named "AddressParser".

jgeocoder was released under the Apache license. This build preserves
the same license.
